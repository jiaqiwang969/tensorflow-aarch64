This repository contains the Jenkins job configurations used by Linaro CI.

Jenkins Job Builder
===================

Jenkins Job Builder (jjb) takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML
format, and uses them to configure Jenkins.

Homepage: http://ci.openstack.org/jjb.html

Note that Linaro CI may use a modified Jenkins Job Builder and may include
some patches which are not yet upstreamed. These changes are included in
latest Debian/Ubuntu packages.

Job Configurations
==================

In order to keep the jobs consistent, please follow this guideline:
 * Job name
   - lower case
   - avoid spacing
 * YAML
   - file name matching the job name

Workflow
========

Changes made to this repository are monitored and trigger an automatic
deployment on the Jenkins master instance (only jobs changes with last
commit(s) will be deployed).

Note: changes made through Jenkins web interface will be LOST.

To manually force a Jenkins job update:
1. Install jenkins-job-builder package
2. Copy provided jenkins_jobs.ini-sample to jenkins_jobs.ini
3. Edit jenkins_jobs.ini user/password settings as appropriate
4. Run the job builder in test mode:

    jenkins-jobs --conf=jenkins_jobs.ini test <job>.yaml

4. Update the job on the Jenkins master:

    jenkins-jobs --conf=jenkins_jobs.ini update <job>.yaml
